🚀 **Overview**

The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts student performance based on demographic, social, and academic attributes.

Problem type → Supervised Learning (Classification & Regression experiments possible).

Objective → Predict final grade / pass-fail outcome of students.

Approach → Data preprocessing → Feature engineering → Model training → Hyperparameter tuning → Model evaluation → Deployment.

🌟 **Project Features**

Clean & modular ML pipeline (src/).

Multiple algorithms tested:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

XGBoost

CatBoost

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV.

Performance comparison of all models.

Model interpretability using feature importance.

Deployed via a Flask application (application.py) for user input and prediction.

Packaged with setup.py for installability.

Complete logging & exception handling.

🛠 **Tech Stack**

Programming Language: Python 3.9+

Libraries & Tools:

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

scikit-learn

xgboost, catboost

Flask (for deployment)

joblib / pickle (for model persistence)

📂 **Dataset**

Dataset: Student Performance Dataset (UCI ML Repository)

Attributes include:

Demographics (age, gender, family background)

Academic records (study time, failures, absences, grades)

Social factors (internet access, family support, activities)

Target variable: Final Grade (G3) or pass/fail indicator.
