            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                This project leverages <strong>Machine Learning</strong> to predict a student's academic performance 
                based on various social, personal, and academic factors. By analyzing data patterns, 
                the model helps identify which students may need additional support to succeed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The model has been trained on the widely used 
                <strong>UCI Student Performance Dataset</strong>. Multiple algorithms such as Logistic Regression, 
                Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and CatBoost were evaluated, with ensemble models 
                showing the highest prediction accuracy.

        <!-- Purpose -->
        <section>
            <h2>What Does This App Do?</h2>
            <p>
                This web application takes details of a student as input 
                (like age, study time, and past failures) and predicts whether the student 
                is likely to perform well academically. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Such predictions can help <strong>teachers, parents, and students</strong> 
                make informed decisions, take corrective actions, and ultimately 
                improve academic outcomes.
            </p>
